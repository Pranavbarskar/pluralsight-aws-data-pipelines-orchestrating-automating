## Course Overview

Modern data pipelines aren’t just about movement—they’re about coordination, visibility, and trust.  
This course teaches you how to **design, orchestrate, and automate production-grade data workflows** on AWS using managed services like **AWS Step Functions**, **Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (Amazon MWAA)**, **Amazon S3**, and **AWS Lambda**.

By the end of this course, you’ll know how to build resilient, event-driven, and observable data pipelines that scale with your organization’s needs.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this course, you’ll learn how to:

- **A.** Design modular and maintainable AWS data pipeline architectures  
- **B.** Use **AWS Step Functions** to orchestrate multi-step workflows  
- **C.** Integrate **Amazon MWAA (Airflow)** for cross-platform orchestration  
- **D.** Implement error handling, retries, and observability patterns  
- **E.** Automate deployments and optimize cost and performance

## Course Modules

| Module | Title | Key Focus |
|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | **Foundations of Data Pipeline Orchestration** | Why orchestration matters, AWS service roles, and core concepts |
| 2 | **Building Step Functions Workflows** | States, transitions, inputs/outputs, retries, and failure paths |
| 3 | **Managing Workflow Resilience** | Error handling, DLQ (Dead-Letter Queue), and visibility with CloudWatch |
| 4 | **Integrating Amazon MWAA** | DAGs, cross-platform orchestration, and hybrid patterns |
| 5 | **Deploying and Operating Pipelines** | CI/CD automation, cost governance, and monitoring strategies |

## Demo Environments

All AWS demonstrations use:

- **Account ID:** `081448897918`
- **Region:** `us-east-1`
- **Sample resources:**  
  - `ps-demo-airflow` (Amazon MWAA environment)  
  - `ps-demo-stepfunction` (workflow example)  
  - `ps-demo-s3` (data lake bucket)

Each demo includes:
- Clear **objectives**
- **Setup**, **execution**, and **teardown** steps
- Failure + recovery scenario
- Cost considerations

## Authoring Standards

This course adheres to the **Pluralsight Video Content and Keynote Template 2025.02.a standards**, including:

- PS TT Commons and Roboto Mono fonts  
- Title Case for titles; Sentence case for body text  
- No periods in bullets; ≤3 lines per bullet  
- AWS-official terminology and architecture icons  
- 2–6 minute clips with modular narration (WHY → WHAT → HOW)  
- Realistic AWS examples (no fictional companies)
